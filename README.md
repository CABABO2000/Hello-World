Hello World | NeoForge
=======

This is a simple barebones mod made for 1.21.4 and NeoForge that prints "Hello World!" to the console upon initilalization of the game.
The code can be found in HelloWorld.java in a method titled commonSetup. The output can be found near the end of initialization in the console.
